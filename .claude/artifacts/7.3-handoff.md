# 7.3 Handoff: Configuration Support Types

## Status: COMPLETE

## Spec Compliance Mapping

| Spec Section | Type | Fields | Implementation | Test |
|--------------|------|--------|----------------|------|
| 7.3.1 | AudioDecoderSupport | supported, config | lib/types.ts:783-786 | type tests (3) |
| 7.3.2 | VideoDecoderSupport | supported, config | lib/types.ts:664-667 | type tests (3) |
| 7.3.3 | AudioEncoderSupport | supported, config | lib/types.ts:741-744 | type tests (3) |
| 7.3.4 | VideoEncoderSupport | supported, config | lib/types.ts:586-589 | type tests (3) |

## Test Coverage

| Category | Count | All Pass? |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| AudioDecoderSupport: 7.3.1 | 3 | YES |
| VideoDecoderSupport: 7.3.2 | 3 | YES |
| AudioEncoderSupport: 7.3.3 | 3 | YES |
| VideoEncoderSupport: 7.3.4 | 3 | YES |
| Type exports | 4 | YES |
| Config field is cloned | 4 | YES |
| **Total** | **20** | **YES** |

## Tests Added

`test/unit/config-support-types.test.ts`:

**AudioDecoderSupport: 7.3.1:**
- should have supported boolean field
- should have config field of type AudioDecoderConfig
- should have config present even when supported is false

**VideoDecoderSupport: 7.3.2:**
- should have supported boolean field
- should have config field of type VideoDecoderConfig
- should have config present even when supported is false

**AudioEncoderSupport: 7.3.3:**
- should have supported boolean field
- should have config field of type AudioEncoderConfig
- should have config present even when supported is false

**VideoEncoderSupport: 7.3.4:**
- should have supported boolean field
- should have config field of type VideoEncoderConfig
- should have config present even when supported is false

**Type exports:**
- should export AudioDecoderSupport type
- should export VideoDecoderSupport type
- should export AudioEncoderSupport type
- should export VideoEncoderSupport type

**Config field is cloned:**
- should have cloned config (AudioDecoder)
- should have cloned config (VideoDecoder)
- should have cloned config (AudioEncoder)
- should have cloned config (VideoEncoder)

## Implementation Notes

All four Support types are correctly defined in lib/types.ts:
- AudioDecoderSupport: { supported: boolean, config: AudioDecoderConfig }
- VideoDecoderSupport: { supported: boolean, config: VideoDecoderConfig }
- AudioEncoderSupport: { supported: boolean, config: AudioEncoderConfig }
- VideoEncoderSupport: { supported: boolean, config: VideoEncoderConfig }

Each type:
- Has required `supported` boolean field
- Has required `config` field with properly typed config
- Config is cloned (not reference to original)
- Config present even when supported is false

## Files Modified

- `test/unit/config-support-types.test.ts`: New test file with 20 tests

## Downstream Unblocked

- None (types are complete)
