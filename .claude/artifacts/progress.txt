Google C++ Style Guide Compliance Review - Progress Tracker
=============================================================

Target: 27 C++ files in src/
Focus: Semantic issues that linters/formatters cannot catch

Phase 1: EXPLORATION ✅ COMPLETED
-----------------------------------
[✅] Read all header files (14 files)
[✅] Read all source files (13 files)
[✅] Group files by similarity
[✅] Understand architectural patterns

Grouping:
- Codec classes: VideoEncoder, VideoDecoder, AudioEncoder, AudioDecoder
- Data containers: VideoFrame, AudioData, EncodedVideoChunk, EncodedAudioChunk
- Utilities: ffmpeg_raii.h (RAII wrappers)
- Workers: AsyncEncodeWorker, AsyncDecodeWorker
- Support: Demuxer, ImageDecoder, VideoFilter

Phase 2: ANALYSIS ✅ COMPLETED
-----------------
[✅] Check naming & semantic meaning
    - Found 4 struct→class violations
    - Identified anonymous namespace inconsistencies
[✅] Check code organization
    - Verified header self-containment (all pass)
    - Checked include order (minor issues)
    - Reviewed forward declarations (all correct)
[✅] Check design patterns
    - RAII usage exemplary
    - unique_ptr ownership clear
    - No virtual calls in constructors/destructors
[✅] Check comments & documentation
    - File headers excellent
    - Missing namespace closing comments (3 files)
    - Complex logic needs more comments (2 instances)
[✅] Check memory & lifetime
    - CRITICAL: Non-trivial static objects in video_frame.cc
    - Raw pointer ownership documented but could be clearer
[✅] Check thread safety
    - Atomic usage correct
    - ThreadSafeFunction usage excellent
    - Missing mutable on const methods (1 instance)
[✅] Check error handling
    - CRITICAL: Missing explicit on 13+ constructors
    - No RTTI usage (good)
    - Inconsistent throw patterns (minor)
[✅] Check miscellaneous (function length, operator overloading)
    - 5+ functions exceed 80 lines (Configure methods)
    - No operator overloading issues

Phase 3: REPORTING ✅ COMPLETED
------------------
[✅] Create findings report (style-review-findings.md)
[✅] Categorize issues by severity
    - Critical: 5 issues
    - Moderate: 12 issues
    - Minor: 6 issues
[✅] Provide specific recommendations with code examples

Phase 4: SUMMARY ✅ COMPLETED
----------------
[✅] Generate executive summary

REVIEW COMPLETED: 2025-12-30
Total Issues Found: 23
Total Time: ~2 hours of analysis
